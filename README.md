# Product-Landing-Page
on the fourth days of FreeCodeCamp learning HTML and CSS 

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - https://product-landing-page-1-0.netlify.app/

## Features
not great but good mobility accessibilty as it is terrible on vertical facing phone but great on horizontal.
teleport at fixed position.
alot of picture representation.
broken video section that wont show.
buy book section (just for show).
information section.



## Built With
HTML - i did not do much as I did to the last one with html, I just use div, and hr to create divider and boxes for each section which most unique was adding video but i dont think it work, so if someone know how to fix that tell me since i try the other method of adding video and it just broke my page.
CSS - i try out alot of them such as grid, fixed position, and border-radius which i try putting alot of my time into.


## Attempt
time = aproximently 7 hour~.
ideas = this one was planned more then the last three and was reference by website with these aesthetic, which i dont remeber what website but i some similar to these.

##Extra Comment By Me
I like this one for looking pretty nice and like most shopping website, not talking about the big companies one but those basic one and it was so hard for some reason to fit the requirment of navbar being at the top of the viewport, and the best on layout but 2nd worst in color also decoration compare to the last three.
